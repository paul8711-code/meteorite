# Contributing to `meteorite`

## Rules & Standards

### Code formatting

All code must be formatted with `cargo fmt`.

### Linting

Your code must pass `cargo clippy` with zero warnings.

### Pull Requests

To keep our Git history clean and maintainable, please ensure your Pull Request meets the following standards before submitting:

#### 1. Proper PR Title

Your PR title must be a clear, one-liner summary of your changes and **must follow the Conventional Commits specification**.

* **Good:** `feat(auth): add oauth login capability`
* **Bad:** `type/branch-name` (Do not just copy-paste your branch name as the title)

#### 2. Reasonably sized Commits

Each commit should represent a single, isolated logical change. Avoid bunching fixed typos, refactors, and new features all into one massive commit.

#### 3. Quality Commit Messages

Each commit within your branch should have a meaningful, descriptive message explaining *what* was changed and *why*.

### Commit messages

We follow the **Conventional Commits** specification.

Examples:

* `feat: add user profile`
* `fix(auth): resolve login panic`

### AI Usage

The usage of generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Claude, or large-scale Copilot generation) to write code or documentation for this project is strictly prohibited.

* **Allowed:** Basic IDE code-completion for syntax.
* **Prohibited:** Generating entire functions, algorithms, or copy-pasting AI-generated PR descriptions.
We value human-authored code where the contributor deeply understands the logic, edge cases, and architectural choices being made.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork or Clone** the repository.
2. **Create a new branch** from `main`:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b type/your-branch-name
    ```

   ### Naming convention

   Your branch name **must** start with one of the following types, followed by a slash and a short, hyphen-separated description of your work:

   * **`feature/`**: For adding new features and capabilities (e.g. `feature/sso-login`).
   * **`fix/`**: For fixing broken code or resolving panics (e.g. `fix/prevent-overflow`).
   * **`chore/`**: For maintenance, dependency updates or documentation tweaks (e.g. `chore/update-readme`).

   *Note: Branches that do not follow our naming structure will not be merged.*

3. Check out [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) or search for comments in code starting with `TODO`
